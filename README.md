# Smart Contract for Near certification
The code for the Smart Contract is in the src lib.rs. The Smart contract relates to the Guessing_game example but this one prompts the Host to enter the number of participants(i.e it loops until the last participant guesses his/her lucky number). In this Smart contract each participant is supposed to enter their name and two lucky numbers between 1 and 9 without repeating a number e.g 12(of which interms of code it's a single two digit number). The program code generates a random number between 10 and 99 but numbers with 0(eg 20) or with repeated digits(eg 77) are not generated. if either of the participants gueses the right number he/she Wins otherwise loses and it prints name: won/lost.

The smart contracts also has tests.
